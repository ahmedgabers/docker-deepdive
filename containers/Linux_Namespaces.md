## Linux Namespaces

- Namespaces allow the kernel to isolate processes, network interfaces, and mount points

- Docker is a namespacing tool

- Processes are maintained in a parent-child hierarchy

- On Linux, the "init system" (or "init" in short) is PID 1.

- It is the first process started by the kernel when the system starts.
